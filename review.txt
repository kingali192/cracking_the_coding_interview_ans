My Cracking the coding interview system:

Every week I will go through one chapter from chapter 1 to the moderate and hard problems.
I will do a problem or two a day and when I do the problem I will solve on my own first then go and read the solution 
to the problem to see if I match or not or if I can optomize my solution.

Problems I should go through again:
Arrays & Strings:
    1.3
    1.7
    1.8
    1.9

Linked Lists:
    2.4
    2.5
